# Lists and Recursion

## Heads and Tails

Earlier we said a list may either be empty or consist of a head and a tail. The head contains a value and the tail is itself a list. This is a recursive definition.

```elixir
iex(1)> head = 3
3
iex(2)> tail = [4, 5]
[4, 5]
iex(3)> newlist = [head | tail]
[3, 4, 5]
iex(4)> list1 = [2,3]
[2, 3]
iex(5)> list1 = [2 | [3|[]]]
[2, 3]
iex(9)> magiclist = [1 | [2 | [3 | []]]]
[1, 2, 3]
# pattern matching with lists:
iex(10)> [a, b, c] = [1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]
# pattern matching with lists and the pipe operator:
iex(11)> [ head | tail ] = [ 1, 2, 3 ]
[1, 2, 3]
iex(12)> tail
[2, 3]
iex(13)> head
1
```

Elixir knows to deploy the pipe operator to the right of the list, so that the list is the first argument to the pipe operator. The pipe operator then passes the list to the function on the right, which in this case is the cons operator, `|`. The cons operator takes the head and the tail and returns a new list.

### Excursion: Representation of strings in Elixir

* `"cat"`
* [99, 97, 116] => (ASCII codes for "cat")

When elixir sees a list like [99,97,116] it doesnâ€™t know if it is supposed to be the string 'cat' or a list of three numbers. So it uses a heuristic.
So, if all the values in a list represent printable characters, it displays the list as a string; otherwise it displays a list of integers.

[99,97,116,0] (=> [99,97,116,0]) is not a string as _0_ is not a printable character.

## Using Head and Tail to process a List

```elixir
defmodule MyList do
  def length([]), do: 0
  def length([_head | tail]), do: 1 + length(tail)
end
```
